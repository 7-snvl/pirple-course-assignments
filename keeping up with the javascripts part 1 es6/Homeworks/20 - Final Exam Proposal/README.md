# Keeping Up With the Javascripts - Part 1: ES6

## Homework 20 `Final Exam Proposal`

Research five **open-source JavaScript projects** that I might contribute code to.

* Favorite project chosen: [**clipboard.js**](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js)

| Projects | Why I like the project? | Contribution proposition |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| [**clipboard.js**](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js) | This library is used to copy text in the clipboard in an easy and orderly way. It really seems like something simple, but before knowing this project, doing something as basic as copying text, was not something comfortable or easy to do. | [Issue #629:](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js/issues/629) I want copy text in cell (table) with string='' |
| [**Moment.js**](https://github.com/moment/moment/) | I really like this project, since it's a library to manipulate dates and times in a very simple way. Handling dates is complicated, and this library does it in an incredibly beautiful way. | [Issue #3980:](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/3980) Incorrect month diff when time involved |
| [**ScrollReveal**](https://github.com/scrollreveal/scrollreveal) | This project helps us activate animations and other functionalities when the user scrolls to a certain place of the website. With this you can create interactive experiences faster than before. | [Issue #471:](https://github.com/scrollreveal/scrollreveal/issues/471) Reveal does not animate when fired from onload event callbacks of uncached images |
| [**Plyr**](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr) | This video player is a very nice asset to add to our code, and we can customize it so that it has the design of our project. | [Issue #1122:](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues/1122) Settings menu disappears on click when video is playing |
| [**validator.js**](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) | I like this library very much, because it serves to do something tedious, such as validating content entered by the user, such as format email, numbers, dates, etc. Another library that helps us to validate the information of users, to improve the experience. | [Issue #948:](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js/issues/948) Email validation |
